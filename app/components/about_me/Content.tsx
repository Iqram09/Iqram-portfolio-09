      I&apos;m Iqram Patel, a passionate software and game developer with expertise
      in C++, C# (ASP.NET), and Unreal Engine. I enjoy creating immersive
      experiences and building scalable web applications using Next.js, MongoDB,
      and SQL/NoSQL databases. With a strong foundation in cloud computing and
      DevOps practices, I leverage AWS to optimize performance and streamline
      deployment processes. My curiosity drives me to constantly learn and
      adapt, whether it&apos;s mastering new frameworks or solving complex challenges
      across game development and full-stack projects.
